Anime Search Web App

Project Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to search for anime, filter them based on their ratings, and switch between light and dark modes. The app also has a feature where users can add their favorite anime to a list and view Pokémon details using a public API. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of the json-server to simulate a local API.
